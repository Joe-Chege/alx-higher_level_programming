#JavaScript Warm-up
This project is a set of tasks that will help you learn the basics of JavaScript programming. The tasks cover topics such as variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, and objects.

Tasks
The tasks are as follows:

0-javascript_is_amazing.js: This task creates a constant variable called myVar with the value "JavaScript is amazing" and prints it to the console.
1-multi_languages.js: This task prints three lines to the console: "C is fun", "Python is cool", and "JavaScript is amazing".
2-arguments.js: This task prints a message depending on the number of arguments passed to the script. If no arguments are passed, the message "No argument" is printed. If one argument is passed, the message "Argument found" is printed. If more than one argument is passed, the message "Arguments found" is printed.
3-value_argument.js: This task prints the first argument passed to the script. If no arguments are passed, the message "No argument" is printed.
4-concat.js: This task prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: " is ".
5-to_integer.js: This task prints "My number: <first argument converted in integer>" if the first argument can be converted to an integer. If the argument cannot be converted to an integer, the message "Not a number" is printed.
6-multi_languages_loop.js: This task prints three lines to the console (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of strings and a loop.
7-multi_c.js: This task prints x times "C is fun". Where x is the first argument of the script. If the first argument cannot be converted to an integer, the message "Missing number of occurrences" is printed.
8-square.js: This task prints a square. The first argument is the size of the square. If the first argument cannot be converted to an integer, the message "Missing size" is printed. The square should be printed using the character X.
9-add.js: This task prints the addition of two integers. The first argument is the first integer. The second argument is the second integer. You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b).
10-factorial.js: This task computes and prints a factorial. The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial. Factorial of NaN is 1. You must do it recursively. You must use a function.
Requirements
To complete this project, you will need the following:

A text editor or IDE
A JavaScript interpreter, such as Node.js
Instructions
To complete each task, follow the instructions in the README file for that task.

Tips
Here are a few tips for completing the tasks:

Use the JavaScript documentation to learn about the different features of the language.
Use online resources, such as Stack Overflow, to get help if you get stuck.
Don't be afraid to experiment and try different things.
Submission
To submit your project, create a GitHub repository and add the completed tasks. Then, share the link to your repository with your instructor.
