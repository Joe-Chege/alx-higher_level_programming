## 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

### Introduction

In this project, you will learn how to use object-relational mapping (ORM) to interact with a database in Python. ORMs provide a layer of abstraction between your code and the database, making it easier to manage data.

### ORMs

ORMs work by mapping Python objects to database tables. This means that you can interact with your database using Python objects, rather than SQL queries. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.

### SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is a popular ORM for Python. It is powerful and flexible, and it can be used with a variety of databases.

### This project

In this project, you will use SQLAlchemy to interact with a MySQL database. You will learn how to:

* Connect to a database
* Create tables and models
* Insert, update, and delete data
* Query data

### Getting started

To get started, you will need to install Python and SQLAlchemy. You can do this using the following commands:

```
pip install python3
pip install sqlalchemy
```

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can create a new Python file and start writing your code.

### Example

The following example shows how to use SQLAlchemy to create a simple table and model:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

# Create the engine
engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqldb://root:root@localhost/my_database')

# Create the base class
Base = declarative_base()

# Create the table
class State(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'states'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(256))

# Create the table in the database
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

Now that we have created the table and model, we can start inserting data:

```python
# Create a new state object
state = State(name='California')

# Insert the state object into the database
session = Session(engine)
session.add(state)
session.commit()
```

We can also query the database for data:

```python
# Query all states from the database
session = Session(engine)
states = session.query(State).all()

# Print the states
for state in states:
    print(state.name)
```

### Conclusion

ORMs provide a powerful and flexible way to interact with databases in Python. SQLAlchemy is a popular ORM that is easy to use and can be used with a variety of databases.
